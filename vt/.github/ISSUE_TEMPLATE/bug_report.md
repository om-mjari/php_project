This is NOT a help board. If you have questions about:

* Integration with React, Vue, Angular, or a PHP e-commerce framework,
* Glasses Studio 3D,
* How to add your own 3D models,
* How to set materials or textures of your 3D models,

Please contact us by email at contact__at__jeeliz.com, we will make you an offer.

If you have a bug with the widget: compatibility error, camera access, or a feature request, you are welcome to post it here. Thank you very much for helping us to improve this product. Please provide:

* A clear and concise description of the bug: what you expect and what happens,
* How to reproduce it (a code chunk or a link would be great),
* Some screenshots if applicable,
* Detailed information about your configuration, especially if you are facing a compatibility error with a specific device. Please read [this section of the README](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizGlassesVTOWidget#compatibility).
